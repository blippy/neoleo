* Fix bug 47: Arch build fix (fingers crossed) 
https://github.com/blippy/neoleo/issues/47


## INSTALLATION

Every Linux distro seems to invent its own way of screwing up the
build process. It is known to build on Debian Bullseye as of
2022-01-01. If it fouls up on your machine, then please raise an
issue. Fixing the build is likely to be a collaborative process,
as it will be unlikely that I will have your distro installed.


### DISTRO PACKAGE MAINTAINERS AND REGULAR USERS

You should download neoleo-12.0.tar.gz, untar it, and issue
the usual:
	./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install
Or words to that effect. Different distros will have their
own secret sauce as to how to construct packages.


### GIT

You can also use git, if you like:
	git clone https://github.com/blippy/neoleo.git
	cd neoleo
	autoreconf -iv
	./configure && make && make install


### COMPILING ON DEBIAN BULLSEYE

Debian Bullseye uses g++  10.2.1 (or better), which has better C++17
compliance. There is no need to resort to the compilation tricks as stated
in NEWS for release version 11.0. Just configure the software in the
regular way.

Dependencies are listed in the file INSTALL-debian, and you can
install them by issuing the command:
	bash INSTALL-debian


### DEBIAN-ESQUE DISTROS

The Ubuntus, Mints, and other derivatives of Debian can probably
apply the notes for Debian as given above.



===========================================================================
VERSION: 11.0
STATUS:  RELEASED
DATE:    2021-02-13
NAME:    SKINNY PETE

This release is a clean-up and configuration nuisance cleanup.

Time for an annual release. I'm now not releasing GNU tarballs, as
it adds more complexity, and not much convenience. If you are on
Linux, then download the tar-gz source code, unpack it (this will
create a dir called neoleo), then

cd neoleo
autoreconf -iv
./configure # or whatever options you require


CODEBASE

`cloc' now reports a line count of less than 10K. More reductions
are possible, although I will probably want to add features at
some point.

COMPILING ON DEBIAN BUSTER

This will include people running Raspbian and Mint. G++ is at version 8.3.0,
which has some compilation annoyances. The recommended way to
configure neoleo is:
	env LIBS=-lstdc++fs CXXFLAGS='-Wno-psabi' ./configure

Run:
	make clean
beforehand if you received compilation errors

COMPILING ON ARCH

* Fixed "fortification" compilation bug 
https://github.com/blippy/neoleo/issues/44 (-Werror=stringop-overflow in col_to_str())



===========================================================================
VERSION: 10.0
STATUS:  RELEASED
DATE:    2020-05-27
NAME:    BREAKING BAD

* Compilation fixes for g++ 10.1.0 and pesky Arch Linux fortifications

* copy row functionality reintroduced

* insert and remove row fixed

* 2019 parser is now the default. Old parsing removed.

* Lots of memory leak fixes. C stuff which was a big problem has been
replaced by more tractable C++ code.


 
===========================================================================
VERSION: 9.0
STATUS:  RELEASED
DATE:    2020-01-05

* Removed '-x' command-line option. The 'experimental' GUI is now the
GUI that replaces the previous version

* Added '-p' command-line option. This uses the experimental parser
started in 2019. It is by no means complete.

* Added sumr() function, to sum a range. It is like sum(),
but takes 4 parameters instead of a range. It is useful
if you want to use relative ranges based on current row()
and col(), for example.

* Input interface heavily reworked. It is now more vi-like.
Use `=' to change a cell, for example.

* Commands don't work anymore.

* Fixed C-l, C-r, cell alignment

* Eliminated the creation of backup files

* Removed keybinding C-x C-s for save-spreadsheet. Use C-s instead.

* Removed reading of init file

* Removed many date functions. C++ has date-parsing libraries, so it's
better to use those if needed. If anyone finds that their much-needed
date function has disappeared, then let me know, and I'll see what I 
can do.

* Added headless command `g", for `goto-cell'



===========================================================================
VERSION: 8.0.0
STATUS:  RELEASED
DATE:    2019-01-21

NEARLY EVERYONE SHOULD DOWNLOAD THE FILE "neoleo-x.y.z.tar.gz" INSTEAD OF 
THE ONES LABELLED "Source code". THE FORMER IS A GNU-STANDARD RELEASE 
TARBALL, THE LATTER ONES ARE JUST ARCHIVES OF THE REPO.

* C++17 COMPILER IS NOW REQUIRED

* many functions removed. I've adopted the policy that if I don't use them
personally, then I'll get rid of them. This greatly alleviates the
maintenance nightmare. If anyone finds that a needed function is deleted
then let me know, and I'll reinstate it. It's an ongoing process to try
to move functions from 'core' to 'user'. 'core' functions are a bit
tedious to deal with.

* small changes in the file format
	May cause incompatability issues, but I'm not expecting it.

* removed help system. Read the html file instead

* added command test-curses-suspension


===========================================================================
VERSION: 7.0.0
STATUS:  RELEASED
DATE:    2017-12-04

* added command: save-dsv

* now compiles on a Raspberry Pi (3). All unit tests pass.

* added lab/csv2hless.py as a better way of putting problem CSV files into
  neoleo. Typical usage:
	python3 csv2hless.py <data.csv | neoleo -H

* removed support for sylk and sc files

* RFE#29 done: quit using C-q

* REF#28 done: set default format to general.float

* RFE#25 done: support groff tbl format

* RFE#23 done: quickstart should mention C-g

* RFE#20 done: Delete key should delete a cell

* BUG#16 done: headless doesn't insert blank

* BUG#25 done: M-x arrow keys don't work properly

* RFE#24 done: C-s should save spreadsheet

* Headless words added: 
	# comment line
	colours (set coloured output mode)
	copy-this-cell-formula
	I (insert data row-wise)
	i (insert columnar data)
	info (mostly for debugging purposes)
	paste-this-cell-formula
	q (quit)
	type-dsv (type spreadsheet in tab-delimited format)
	vi (visual mode - experimental)
	w (write to file)

* RFE#22 done: fix home, end and delete keys

* RFE#21 done: make home and end keys work in edit mode

* RFE#19 done: copying and pasting of current cell. 
Bindings are now:
	C-c copy-this-cell-formula
	C-l set-cell-alignment-left
	M-m show-menu
	C-r set-cell-alignment-right
	C-v paste-this-cell-formula

* BUG#18 done: Cell reference parsing

* BUG#17 done: Copy region

* BUG#15 done: string find function is buggy

* Added macros: copy-row

* Removed X11 support

* Removed font support


===========================================================================
VERSION 6.0.0 RELEASED 07-JUL-2017

* Removed mysql functionality

* Page UP/Down and Home work (issue #13)

* Pasting now dirties the document (issue #11)

* Default alignment is now Right instead of Left. Seems more natural.

* Removed readline support (issue #12), as it is redundant.

* 32-bit support re-instated (due to removing Forth. See next point).

* Disabled Forth because it required 64-bit architecture. 

* Improved formatting of 0.0. (issue #10)

* Removed support for: Motif, printing, plotting
  There is too much maintenance work in it. I'm not sure anyone even
  uses neoleo for more than 5 minutes anyway.

* X11 being deprecated. `configure --with-x' if you still want it.

* Importing oleo graphs disabled. They caused crashes (issue #8)


===========================================================================
VERSION 5.0.0 RELEASED 31-MAR-2017

* Fixed issue 6: Install the FAQ and README
	https://github.com/blippy/neoleo/issues/6

* default name for spreadsheets is now `unnamed.oleo' in the absence
	of any other information

* neoleo now opens a non-existent file

* falls back to terminal automatically if X11 display not detected

* decimals are used instead of floats. This should greatly improve
  formatting

* added examples/oleo.pm6 - converts oleo files to csv

* atlast Forth (64-bit) embedded. Words added: 
	4getenv, 4life, 4included, 4prform, 
	4system, 4xcmd

* added `-4' Forth file command option to specify a Forth file to run at 
	startup. Users can therefore add their own canned routines
	more easily. 

* added `-H' headless mode, which accepts Forth commands

* 32-bit support dropped, as Oleo relies on the atlast 64-bit version.

* issue4: Fonts now work in X11
	https://github.com/blippy/neoleo/issues/5

* removed support for Tcl scripting

* reinstated support for X11

* `shell' command added. See also TR2.

  https://github.com/blippy/neoleo/issues/3

* Issued TR01: Formatting of cell values.
  Applicable to users and devs

* support for vanilla X11 dropped

* added support for Tcl scripting

05-Dec-2016



===== neoleo 4.0.0 =====

This is just an experimental compilation test. 

In future, I anticipate packaging to be smoother.

DO NOT USE.

01-Dec-2016



===== neoleo 3.0.1 =====

Fixed a schoolboy error in the way that make dist worked. It left
out the headers.

If you are downloading the file from github, most people, especially
distro packagers wanting to do typical configure && make && make install
should download the file neoleo-X.Y.Z.tar.gz, rather than the
source files.

28-Nov-2016



===== neoleo 3.0 =====

Added X11 and Motif support, where available. 

Still no internationalisation or documentation. Infrastructure is there,
it just does not build as yet.

Fixed bug whereby the original code seemed to crash if X support
was built in, but there was no X display. A bit rude, that. It would
be even better, though, if neoleo would automatically fall back to 
ncurses.

If you are downloading the file from github, most people, especially
distro packagers wanting to do typical configure && make && make install
should download the file neoleo-X.Y.tar.gz, rather than the
source files.

28-Nov-2016

===== neoleo 2.0 =====

First successful compilation in 15 years!?

ncurses version works, but many things have been disabled in order
to have a basic compile.

Excluded: internationalisation, documentation, X11 and Motif interface.

19-Nov-2016



===== Oleo 1.99.8 =====

Lots of internal cleanup so the Motif version of Oleo stands a chance
of running multiple windows simultaneously. The capability is there,
it needs to be handled effectively from the menus.

Printing is reworked to be more device independent. The original goal
was to support my Epson printer (Stylus Color 400) and PCL in addition
to PostScript. The Epson code may never become real but PCL looks ok.
All this required using AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) files to get things to
work reliably.

Plotutils support is better, it can show windows with scrollbars, the
user can resize the windows, etc.

Unfortunately a lot of this needs work in the Motif code to make it
more accessible to the user; this is for the next minor release.

The raw X code has work to make it accept internationalised input
(aka i18n support). I cloned the code I originally implemented in
LessTif but it doesn't (yet) work here. Sigh.

Documentation is now one HTML file (texi2html -monolithic) so it
can be handled nicely by the XmHTML widget. This also makes access
on the web page much more friendly when browsing the manual.

===== Oleo 1.99.6 =====

Database access (MySQL), internal cleanup of the source code,
and user interface improvements.

Oleo also works with the new version of Xbae (4.7) which was released
July 1999.

===== Oleo 1.99.4 =====

Mostly released for a couple of bugfixes.
They're in the ChangeLog.

===== Oleo 1.99.3 =====

Noteworthy changes in Oleo 1.99.3 :
- SYLK support is much better. This means that the example files that
  I have can be read without error. It does *not* mean that all the
  contents of the files are treated. E.g. we have no support for cell
  borders, multiple graphs, fonts, colour-filled cells, ...
- Oleo now handles noa0 cell addresses of not only its own format
  (such as RC[-2:-3]), but also RC[-2]:RC[-1] - which was needed for
  reading SYLK files.
- Printing is being restructured. PostScript, Epson Stylus Color, and
  PCL support are on the drawing board - only PostScript currently
  prints reasonable things.

===== Oleo 1.99.1 =====

This release is numbered 1.99.1 to indicate that we're working towards a
2.0 release of Oleo.

Stuff that has been added since 1.6 includes :
- build support by GNU automake and GNU autoconf
- bug fixes
- source cleanup
- Motif (LessTif in a free world) graphical user interface
- GNU plotutils
- internationalisation support (not many translations included though)
- filter options allow Oleo to work as a traditional Unix filter program,
  reading from standard input and writing to standard output.
- recognise file name extensions at startup ("oleo q110399.csv" works)


===== Oleo 1.6.13 =====

Oleo 1.6.13 (dated 28 december 1998) has progressed in having a more and more
usable Motif user interface.

It's still largely unimplemented so those who need a good Motif programming
exercise are invited to join.

Please note that Xbae widgets can be found at
  ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/motif/Xbae-4.6.2.tar.gz
in addition to its home page http://www.xbae.syd.net.au/ .


===== Oleo 1.6.7 =====

It's been a loooong time since the latest release of GNU Oleo : version
1.6 dates from June 1994, it's late August 1998 when I'm writing this.

IMPORTANT NOTE : this release is a teaser.

Oleo is not quite ready for a new release now, as a couple of things are
work in progress. This release is made to :
* get the word out to people that something's happening, 
* have people build this release and ensure it works for them.

Since 1994, several people have picked up oleo and modernised it.
Their names are in the AUTHORS file.

Here's a (horribly incomplete) list of improvements :
- build support with automake, autoconf
- Motif interface (LessTif works too)
- i18n (internationalisation)

Important note when building : if "aclocal" complains about duplicates,
then this probably means you have GNU gettext installed (this is good !),
but aclocal can't handle macros in two places. You should just remove
three files from oleo's m4 directory (gettext.m4, lcmessage.m4, progtest.m4).

We should probably remove them and the intl/ directory from GNU Oleo.

If you want to build the Motif interface, you need :
- Xbae widgets (http://www.xbae.syd.net.au)

You probably better also have :
- XmHTML widget if you want help (http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/XmHTML)
- SciPlot widget if you want graphics
	(http://www.ae.utexas.edu/~rwmcm/SciPlot.html)
- GNU gettext (http://www.gnu.org)



===== Oleo 1.6 =====

Many patches from volunteers have been applied.  See the ChangeLog to
determine if your favorite long-standing bug has been fixed.

The file EIGHTBIT contains some patches for Scandinavian character
support.  They correspond to version 1.5 and may require some work for
version 1.6.

===== Oleo 1.5 =====

Various bug and portability fixes.

One central keybinding has change.  `=' is now bound to set-cell instead
of edit-cell.  The difference is that edit-cell prompts you with the current
formula setting fo the cell while set-cell prompts with an empty line.

To restore the old behavior, you can put this line in your .oleorc:

	bind-key main edit-cell =

Also, when editting a cell formula, the function `insert-cell-expression'
inserts the current formula setting of a cell.  By default, it is bound to 
`M-e' (aka ESC e).

** Problems with enums
   Some user sent me mail explaining that he had problems with the way 
   enums are used in the file graph.c.  Unfortunately, i lost that mail.
   If that user sees this -- please send a message to bug-oleo@prep.ai.mit.edu.



===== Oleo 1.4 =====

A whole mess of bugfixes and portability fixes.

Oleo still does not run on systems that lack the `select' system call.
Volunteers who would like to port Oleo to such systems (perhaps
adapting code form GNU Emacs) are encouraged to write to
bug-oleo@prep.ai.mit.edu.

===== Oleo 1.3.1 =====

- Several compilation problems (io-edit.c, autoconf goodies) have been
  fixed, as well as all reported bugs.

- Date formula functions have been added using strftime, localtime, gmtime, mktime,
  GNU get_date, and GNU posixtm.  

  Oleo measures time using integers that count seconds.  Calendar dates
  (as opposed to intervals of time) are measured from 1 Jan 1970 GMT.

  The new Oleo functions are:

	  Computing times from conventional representations:

  hms_to_time		compute an interval from hours, minutes, and seconds
  dhms_to_time		compute an interval from days, hours, minutes, and seconds

  time_to_d		compute the number of days in an interval
  time_to_h		   "	 "     "   "  hours   "    "
  time_to_m 		   "	 "     "   "  minutes "    "
  time_to_s 		   "	 "     "   "  seconds "    "

  ymd			Convert a local year, month, and day to an absolute time.
  ymd_dst		The same, but perhaps overriding normal d.s.t. conventions.

  get_date		Parse a date in the style of GNU date or GNU tar.
  posix_date		Parse a date following Posix syntax.


	   Converting from absolute times to calendar times


  local_year, local_month,		These convert with respect to
  local_date, local_hour,		the local timezone.
  local_min, local_sec,
  local_isdst, local_yday, local_wday

  gmt_year, gmt_month,			These convert with respect to
  gmt_date, gmt_hour,			GMT.
  gmt_min, gmt_sec,
  gmt_isdst, gmt_yday, gmt_wday


  Finally, the miscellaneous pile:

  strftime		Format a time nicely (on-line help (^H^F) has details)



===== Oleo 1.3 =====

- Many keybindings have changed.  The new bindings more closely resemble Emacs.
  Most commands are now bound to control or meta characters.
  Alphanumeric characters begin cell entry.  There are a variety of
  new motion commands.

  The file KEYS contains a wallchart of Oleo bindings.  This file was
  derived from the output of the command `M-x write-wallchart'.

- There is now on-line help for interactive functions and formula
  expressions.  ^H is the help prefix.

- Argument prompting has changed.   Oleo's interactive behavior is now
  much less like vi, and much more like Emacs.  For example, the
  arguments to interactive functions are now prompted for indivdually
  rather than with a single readline.

- Oleo speaks gnuplot.  A series of graph commands (accessed via
  `M-g') can be used to create gnuplot graphs of data in Oleo
  spreadsheets.  X11 users can draw graphs on the screen.  Anyone can
  generate postscript.

- Tax forms!  A volunteer has created the spreadsheet irs-1992.oleo.
  It contains spreadsheets for a number of federal and State of
  Connecticut tax forms.  Thanks to Ronald Florence <ron@mlfarm.com>.

- Larger address space.  By default, Oleo now provides 16 bit cell
  addresses (there are 65535 rows and columns).



===== Oleo 1.2.2 =====

This is a bugfix release.  Nearly all bugs reported for 1.2.1 have
been fixed (a few could not be reproduced).  Many portability problems
have been fixed.

Release 1.2.2 has been built and (minimally) tested on these systems:

	RS/6000 running AIX
	Sun4 running SunOS 4.1.1
	Sun3 running SunOS 4.1.1_U1

A more significant amount of testing has been done on DECstation
5000's running Ultrix 4.2.

===== Oleo 1.2.1 =====

This is a bugfix release.  Various configuration problems and a few
trivial bugs in the 1.2 release have been repaired.

===== Oleo 1.2 =====

This is primarily a bigfix release.  In addition, there are some new features.

* New command line options

  --version or -v: print out a version number
  --quiet or -q: don't print the disclaimer
  --ignore-init-file or -f: don't read commands from .oleorc or ~/.oleorc

* New commands/Changes to commands

  write-variables:  writes to a file or pipe the values of all variables 
	that are bound to cells.  Variables bound to regions are not 
	written.

  read-variables: The inverse of write-variables.  Variables that are
	bound to a range cause an error.  Variables not bound to a
	cell are ignored.

  Format-cell and format-region can now be used to set cell fonts.

  set-region-forumla: This can be used to edit many cells at once.

  {upper,lower}-{left,right}: These commands go to extremes.  They are
  bound to M-{^Y ^U ^B and ^N}.

  {insert,delete}-{row,column}: new commands bound to ^O, ^K, M-^O, M-^K.

  {move,copy}-region: these commands now work (at least for many test cases).

  exchange-point-and-mark: ^X ^X

* File Format Changes

  SYLK mode appears to have changed at some time in the past.  Older
  (and correct, i presume)  versions write cell references in a0
  format.  The last alpha and early beta releases use rc format.  
  Now there are two file formats ``sylk'' and ``sylk-noa0''.
  If older sylk files don't work with one, they may with the other.
  Hopefully, between them, all oleo-generated sylk files can be read.
  Users are encouraged to read and write files in ``oleo'' format (the
  default).

  Oleo file format has changed in a (hopefully) upward compatable way.

  When reading sylk or oleo files, a format error now causes the read
  to be aborted.

  Oleo no longer generates a panic file on any signal (it dumps core
  like everyone else).

* X tweaks
 
  The window now has a title.

  Whatever key corresponds to Mod1Mask is treated as a meta key.

  The resources oleo.geometry, oleo.foreground and oleo.background
  have the expected effects.

* New formula functions

  In the `cells' package there is a new function vlookup_str that can
  be used to search a table, using a keyword string.  See USING.

===== Oleo 1.1 =====

Sat Nov 21 21:03:31 1992

This is a bugfix release.  Release 1.0 had a few trivial, but fatal
bugs, and didn't work at all unless you editted global.h first.  If
you had trouble with that release, please try this one.  

If formulas don't seem to work at all, or if you experience core dumps
when defining formulas, check to see that that the definition of
CELLREF in globals.h is correct for your system.  The current
definitions assume that characters are 8 bits, and the short integers
are 16 bits.

All reported bugs have been fixed.

The opening disclaimer is no longer printed if you have a .oleorc file.
