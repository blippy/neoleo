# Neoleo

Lightweight curses spreadsheet based on GNU oleo.


## Quick start

Keybindings work in the style of vim.

Type `m' to bring up a menu. You can dismiss it by hitting any non-bound key.

Here, `C-` means the `Control character`, `M-` is the mod key, which is
either `Alt` or `ESC`.

| Key   | Purpose                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| =     | Edit a cell                          |
| r     | Do a row command                     |
| C-c   | copy cell formula to clipboard       |
| C-g   | cancels current operation            |
| C-l   | set cell alignment left              |
| C-q   | quit                                 |
| C-r   | set cell alignment right             |
| C-s   | save document                        |
| C-v   | paste cell formula from clipboard    |

Up, down, left right and delete keys should work as expected.

For further keybindings, see the `man neoleo-keys` page. 
You should definitely read that manpage!


## Documents and examples

Neoleo installs examples in a shared directory, typically


## Compiling/installing

In short (as from v10.0+), download from github, unpack
if appropriate, then
```
cd neoleo
autoreconf -iv
./configure # adding relevant options
make
make install
```

Read INSTALL, which contains general instructions, plus specific 
instructions like compiling from git, as well as **trouble-shooting**. 
Platform-specific comments are contained in INSTALL-${platform} 
files. INSTALL-debian covers Debian-derived distros like Ubuntu
and Mint.


## Getting fancy

`Neoleo` comes with a "headerless" mode, where you can interact
via stdin/stdout, a la `ed`. One command that `neoleo` has is
`tbl`, for example, which prints a sheet in `groff`-compatible form. So you
can create your spreadsheet, and create a nice PDF with it, say
by typing the following from the command line:
```
neoleo foo.oleo -H <<<tbl 2>/dev/null | groff -t -Tascii | text2pdf >foo.pdf
```
