@node Key bindings, Headless mode, Top, Top
@chapter Key bindings

Absolute minimum you need to know:
@table @samp
@item Delete
Delete current cell
@item =
Edit a cell. Start with '"' to enter a string. Numbers are entered normally.
@item ^s
Save a file
@item ^q
Quit
@item ^g
Cancels current input/edit
@end table


Here, `C-` means the `Control character`, `M-` is the mod key, which is
either `Alt` or `ESC`.

@item %

@item cal
