@top Neoleo

Neoleo - the spreadsheet program.  This documentation is of Neoleo
version @value{version}, as of @w{@value{update-date}.}  It is by no
means complete, nor necessarily accurate for that matter.

@menu
* Headless mode::
* Key Index::
* Command Index::
* Function Index::
* Options Index::
* Concept Index::
@end menu

Absolute minimum you need to know:
@itemize @bullet{}
@item
`=` to edit a cell. Start with '"' to enter a string. Numbers are entered normally.
@item
`^s` to save a file
@item
`^q` to quit
@item
`^g` cancels any edits you are making
@end itemize

Keybindings work in the style of vim.

html docs will be stored in a place like
/usr/local/share/doc/html

info files stored in
?? /usr/local/share/


Here, `C-` means the `Control character`, `M-` is the mod key, which is
either `Alt` or `ESC`.


| Key   | Purpose                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |


@table @samp
@item %
Toggle percentage mode
@item =
Edit a cell
@item c
Do a volumn command
@end table
| m     | Activate the menu                    |
| &lt;n&gt;p | set cell precision to 'n'        |
| r     | Do a row command                     |
| C-c   | copy cell formula to clipboard       |
| C-g   | cancels current operation            |
| C-l   | set cell alignment left              |
| C-q   | quit                                 |
| C-r   | set cell alignment right             |
| C-s   | save document                        |
| C-v   | paste cell formula from clipboard    |

Up, down, left right and delete keys should work as expected.
