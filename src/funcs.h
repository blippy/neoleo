/*
 * The structure CMD_FUNC describes C functions that can be called
 * interactively. 
 *
 * FUNC_NAME: The name that `execute-function' uses.
 * FUNC_DOC: A `char **' of documentation for the function (NULL terminated).
 * FUNC_ARGS: Similar to an emacs interactive string, however,
 *	      rather than a newline separated string, Oleo uses a `char **'.
 * FUNC_FUNC: The C function the implements the command.
 * INIT_CODE: an array of macros or NULL to be executed before editting
 *	      begins on an interactive argument.
 *
 *      The syntax of FUNC_ARGS:
 *
 *      In this list, ? stands for an optional arbitrary edit buffer name,
 *      delimited by <>.  For example, to prompt for a file:
 *
 *	    "fw<spreadsheets>Save spreadsheet: "
 *
 * 	c? - prompt for a single character.
 *	     If written c', then the prompt times out after a small
 *	     number of seconds, and -1 is passed to the function.
 *	     If written c#, then the first character of the prompt string will
 *	     be passed to the function and the user will not be prompted.
 *      C? - Command name (or the address of a macro or name of a variable)
 *	d  - Prompt for a double precision floating point number.
 *	fr, fw - Get a file name and pass the opened FILE * to the
 *	         function. The file is closed when the function returns.
 *	fn - a file name.
 *	F  - read a cell
 * 	k  - read a keysequence (passed as `struct key').
 * 	K? - read the name of a keymap
 *      l  - last character typed to invoke this command.
 *	m  - the prompt should be a keymap name.  The user is given
 *	     an opertunity to interact using that map as the top-level
 * 	     map until exit-minibuffer is called.  This generates no
 * 	     arguments to the function. 
 *	     Written m', only one keysequence is read, and that is passed
 *	     as a struct keyseq *.
 *      M  - yes or no verify if the buffer has been modified.
 *	N? - Prefix arg as a number, or if none, read from the minibuffer
 *	     Input can be constrained to a particular range like this:
 *			"N[1,16]Format number [1-16]: "
 *	n? - like `N', but it always prompts (never uses the prefix).
 * 	p  - Prefix arg converted to number.  Does not do I/O.
 *	     However, this may be modified by following `p' with:
 *		? - pass 1 if a prefix arg was explicitly provided, else 0.
 *	        r - pass the raw prefix as `struct line *'  (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
 *	r? - Prompt for a range argument (use the mark if it is set).
 *	R? - Prompt for a range argument (don't use the mark, though).
 *	s? - Prompt the user for an arbitrary string.
 *  	S? - Any symbol.  If written S', then a NULL char * will be passed
 *	     if the user doesn't provide a symbol name.
 *      V  - enter a vi-like navigation state.
 *	     In this case, the_cmd_arg.inc_cmd should be set to a hook that
 *	     will repeatedly be called with two integer arguments (a direction
 *	     and repeat count).  (e.g. imove)
 *	w  - read a word (whitespace delimited).  w' means that the empty
 *	     string (normally forbidden) stands for NULL.
 *	#n - N should be an integer.  Pass N (as an int). Does not do I/O.
 *      .  - Return the {mk,}cu{row,col} from the command's frame.
 *	     Written .', the mark is ignored, and a one cell range of 
 *	     cu{row,col} is returned.
 *	$  - Edit a formula, beginning with the current cells formula as
 *	     default.  If you don't want the old formula as default, use $'
 *      [  - like c, except that input is constrained to a particular 
 *	     character set.  e.g.  "[upd][U]nprotected [P]rotected [D]efault "
 *	=  - pass the (expanded) prompt as a string arument.
 *
 * In addition, if the first character of the first FUNC_ARGS string is a `+'
 * then in expanded macro syntax, the name of the function may be followed
 * by an integer that will be made the value of the prefix argument.  For
 * example:  `{go-right 5}' because the FUNC_ARGS string for go-right is: `+p'.
