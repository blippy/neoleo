.SH NOTE 1 - ARROWS

Up, down, left, right and delete keys should work as expected.

Ctrl- left and up arrows are not guaranteed to work on all terminals due to some of their limitations.

.ie c \[shc] \
.  ds softhyphen \[shc]
.el \

.SH NOTE 3 - BOLD

This is a new feature in neoleo 16.0. If you use bold in your format,
the oleo file will be incompatible with prior version. So BEWARE.
